            "time":"3 Hours","title":"Shepard's Pie","image":"pasta","ingredients":["1 tbsp vegetable oil","500g lamb mince","1 large onion, finely diced","1 large carrot, finely diced","2 sticks celery, finely diced","2 garlic cloves, crushed","10g dried ceps (porcini) mushrooms, ground into a powder (I blitz them in a coffee grinder)","200g cherry tomatoes, blitzed to a liquid","1 tbsp tomato purée","1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce","450g hot, fresh chicken stock","1 tbsp mushroom ketchup","1 sprig each of thyme and rosemary","1 tbsp crème fraîche"],
            "steps":[" 1. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the mince. Brown it all over, breaking it down if you need to, then transfer the mince to a plate by the stove."," 2. Add the onion, carrot and celery to the pan and cook until the vegetables are starting to soften. Add a good pinch of salt and cook for another two minutes, then add the garlic and powdered mushrooms and cook for another two minutes."," 3.  When the vegetables are starting to stick to the bottom of the pan, having released all their moisture, add the blitzed cherry tomatoes, tomato purée and Worcestershire sauce. Cook until all the moisture is driven off."," 4. When the mixture starts to stick to the bottom of the pan again, allow a bit of crust to form before adding the mince back to the pan, along with the chicken stock and mushroom ketchup to deglaze, scraping the stuck bits to dislodge them."," 5.  Throw in the thyme and rosemary and cook for about 30 to 45 minutes until the mix is thick and dark. Add a bit of water if the stew threatens to boil dry."," 6. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/Gas 4."," 7.  Add the crème fraîche when the mixture is nearly cooked and let it melt into the mince. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper as required."," 8. Discard the herb stalks. Allow to cool slightly then transfer to a baking dish large enough to allow some potato on top."," 9. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until they are easily penetrated by a sharp knife. Strain in a colander and leave to cool slightly, allowing the moisture to evaporate."," 10.  Push the potatoes through a ricer into another saucepan and add the cream and butter a bit at a time, beating them into the potato, until smooth."," 11. Add the egg yolks and beat them in. At the Sportsman, we press this through a sieve for an even smoother mash, but it can be a drag to do this at home – I’ll leave that up to you. If you have a piping bag, you can pack the potato into the bag and pipe it onto the lamb mince."," 12. If not, just spoon the potato onto the mix and use a hot spatula to spread it evenly. Running a fork over the top will give a nice finish. Cook the pie in the oven for 30 to 45 minutes until the potato is golden brown."]

Add the blitzed cherry tomatoes and reduce until all of the liquid has gone.  Stir in the tomato purée.","  Add the chicken stock and simmer for an hour, covered, but make sure the pan always has enough liquid to cover the meat – add a little water if needed.","  After an hour, add the milk and simmer for another hour."," When the sauce is almost dry, beat in the butter and check the seasoning – it may need more salt."," This can now be kept covered in the fridge for a week or frozen, to use with pasta.","  To serve this with pasta, cook your pasta (egg tagliatelle is best) as per the packet instructions but for a couple of minutes less."," Have a large frying pan ready and add the ragù to it, warming it through."," Add the drained pasta to the pan along with a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water and shimmy the pan as it cooks to coat the pasta in the ragù."," Serve in deep bowls with plenty of grated fresh parmesan."]

            "time":"2 Hours","title":"Pho ga chicken noodle soup with crispy chicken skin","image":"hotdog","ingredients":["4 chicken thighs, skin on and bone in","60g ginger","2 shallots","500ml chicken stock (home-made, or it’s worth splashing out on a carton from the chiller cabinet if you can)","2 star anise","160g pak choi","160g carrots","160g radishes","160g shiitake mushrooms","2 tsp Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce","1 red chilli, thinly sliced","50g rice noodles (dried, not ready to eat)","160g bean sprouts","2 spring onions, thinly sliced","Fresh mint, coriander, and lime wedges to serve"],
           "steps":[" 1. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Pull the chicken skin from the thighs and separate the meat from the bones. Spread the skin out on a baking tray (one with a lip to catch the fat that will run off), stretching it out as much as possible. Sprinkle with salt and then top with another baking tray (or roasting tin), pressing it down to keep the skin flat."," 2. Put the trays in the oven and cook for about 20 minutes until, peeking under the top tray, you can see the skin is golden and crisp. They might take a little longer, but don’t let them get too dark. Lift out the trays carefully and pour away the fat (you can use it for frying potatoes). Use a fish slice to lift the skins on to kitchen paper and leave to cool."," 3. Now make the broth. Thickly slice the ginger and shallots and cook them on a ridged griddle or under a grill until patched with black. Put them in a pan with the stock, chicken bones and star anise and simmer for an hour."," 4.  Prepare the vegetables. Cut the pak choi into eight wedges through the base. Spiralise the carrots or shave them into ribbons with a vegetable peeler. Slice any large radishes thickly."," 5. Add the chicken meat and mushrooms to the broth pan and simmer for 10 minutes or so, until cooked through."," 6.  Lift out the chicken and mushrooms and keep to one side, sprinkling them with one teaspoon of the fish sauce."," 7. Strain the broth and bring back to simmering point, adding half the chilli and seasoning with another teaspoon of fish sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning."," 8.  Cook the noodles for two minutes in boiling water (or according to the packet directions) adding the carrots at the same time, to soften them slightly. Drain."," 9.  Divide the noodles and carrots between two bowls, and top with the bean sprouts, pak choi, mushrooms and chicken, sliced. Ladle over the broth, add the radishes and tuck in the crisp chicken skin."," 10. Serve with the spring onions, herbs and remaining chilli, ready to scatter over, lime to squeeze, and offer more fish sauce at the table."]

            "steps":[" 1. This pancake batter will keep for one or two days in the fridge. Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the egg yolks and milk in the centre then, using a whisk, whisk the flour into them until you have a smooth batter."," 2.  In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold them into the egg and flour mixture and you’re good to go."," 3. Cut the pear into quarters and remove the core. Cut each quarter lengthways into slices about 5mm thick. Set aside."," 4. Heat a small frying pan and add the walnuts. Toast gently over a low heat, taking care not to let them colour too much."," 5. Transfer to a plate and leave to cool. When cool enough to handle, break each walnut into two to three pieces and set aside."," 6. Melt the butter in the same pan over a medium heat, then add the cinnamon. When the butter starts to foam, add the pears and allow to sizzle for a minute."," 7.  Add the honey and turn up the heat to high so the pears start to caramelise until they soften but still retain their shape – this should take no more than four to five minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the pears in the pan."," 8. To cook the pancakes, heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add half the butter and, when it’s foaming, add two 50ml ladlefuls of pancake batter (leaving a gap between them) and cook for two minutes, or until they are light brown on the bottom and starting to set on the top."," 9. Flip over the pancakes and cook for a further minute or so, until brown on the undersides."," 10. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining butter and batter to cook two more pancakes."," 11. Quickly reheat the pear caramel if necessary and spoon over the pancakes. Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and sprinkle over the toasted walnuts."]
